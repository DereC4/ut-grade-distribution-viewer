# Why is this a thing? There are tons of other ones!

I was bored in VAPA one day and then realized that a lot of the popular sites like Catalyst and the UT Registratrion Plus extension showed outdated data or didn't have 
data at all. They may update in the future but for the time being that is an issue (No hate tho, I love UT Registration Plus they laughed at my jokes).
