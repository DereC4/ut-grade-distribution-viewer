## Why is this a thing? 

I'm sure you've all seen this page before:

It's from a (super helpful) registration extension, and shows for more than half the classes looked at. No hate on the extension though, ironically enough, I was actually annexed into the UT Registration Plus team last year.

Bored in VAPA one day, I noticed popular sites like Catalyst and UT Registration Plus showed outdated on grade distributions, or no data at all. They may update in the future but for the time being that is an issue. As a result, I decided to make this website instead of paying attention to the pipelining lecture in 429 that day. Magically, my quiz grade average decreased dramatically that week. Go figure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Using the site is simple, just input the necessary data and voila!
